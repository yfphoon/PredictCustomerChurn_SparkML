# PredictCustomerChurn

This Flask application utilizes IBM's Watson Machine Learning APIs to make predictions against a deployed machine learning
model created using Spark MLlib. T

The model utilizes a RandomForest classifier to predict whether a customer will churn or not based on a number of features
regarding the customer.

An instance of the application running on IBM Bluemix can be accessed at https://predictcustomerchurn.mybluemix.net/
